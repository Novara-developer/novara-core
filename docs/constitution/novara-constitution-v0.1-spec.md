**Status:** Specification Draft  
**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Date:** 2025-11-19  
**License:** CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)

## Preamble

When AI systems make decisions that affect human lives, we need:
- **Evidence** of what happened  
- **Attribution** of who is responsible  
- **Remedy** that is automatic and fair  

This constitution defines the principles and governance structure for evidence-first AI systems.

---

## Article I: Core Principles

### 1. Evidence First
All AI decisions must generate tamper-evident evidence.  
Logs come before features. Proof comes before branding.

### 2. Zero Trust
Verification must never depend on trusting the AI vendor.  
All evidence must be independently verifiable.

### 3. Attribution
Every decision must trace to:
- a specific actor (AI system or human operator)  
- a policy version in effect at the time  
- input data and context  

### 4. Automatic Remedy
When damage exceeds a threshold (≥ ¥10,000):  
- attribution is calculated cryptographically  
- payment is automatic from an SLO-Bond  
- no human negotiation is required  

### 5. Human Dignity
Victims deserve:
- plain-language explanations  
- respectful treatment  
- timely resolution

## Article II: Governance

### Foundation

A future **Novara Foundation** will:

- maintain this constitution  
- certify conformant implementations  
- help manage SLO-Bond pools  
- mediate disputes that exceed automated resolution  

### Independence

The Foundation must:

- take no more than 10% of funding from any single vendor  
- publish all constitutional decisions publicly  
- allow community override of any decision with a 2/3 vote

## Article III: Incident Protocol

Incident handling (damage thresholds, attribution formulas, payment rules)  
is defined in a separate document:

`novara-incident-protocol-v0.1-spec.md`

## Article IV: Amendments

This constitution may be amended:

- by a 2/3 Foundation vote  
- after a public review period of at least 30 days  
- without silently breaking existing implementations
